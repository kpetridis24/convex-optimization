Implementation of minimum-approximation algorithms for single/multi-variable functions

These four implementations are done in the context of the first project in the related subject "Optimization Techniques".
The methods refering to single variable functions are:
- [Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
- [Derivative Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_search_technique)
- [Golden Section Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search)

The methods solving the minimum approximation problem for multi-variable functions are:
- Newton's Method
- Steepest Descent
- Levenberg-Marquardt Method

For method-related parameter calculation, the Armijo rule was used as well.
