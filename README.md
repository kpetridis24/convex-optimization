# optimization-algorithms
Implementation of 4 algorithms that approximately calculate the range, in which the min of a function is located 

These four implementations are done in the context of the first project in the related subject "Optimization Techniques".
The methods included are:
- [Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
- [Derivative Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_search_technique)
- [Golden Section Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search)
